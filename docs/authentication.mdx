To interact with the knowledge base API, you need to include your API key in every request.
This is done by passing it in the `X-Api-Key` header.

You can create and manage your keys directly from your Fernand dashboard under **Integrations → API Key**.

## Managing keys

1. Go to **Integrations** in your workspace settings.
2. Click on **Manage keys** under the **API Key** integration card.
3. Create a new key if you don’t already have one, or copy an existing key.
4. Use this key in the `X-Api-Key` header when making API calls.


## Best practices

* Keep your keys secret. Do not paste them into public repositories or client-side code.
* Rotate your keys regularly for added security.
* If you suspect a leak, revoke the key immediately from this page.


## Making a request

Once you have an API key, include it in the header of your request. For example, fetching the full knowledge base structure:

```
curl -H "X-Api-Key: sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \ https://api.getfernand.com/knowledge/structure
```

Or fetching a single article by its ID:

```
curl -H "X-Api-Key: sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \ https://api.getfernand.com/knowledge/articles/<ARTICLE_ID>
```

That’s all you need to start authenticating with the Fernand knowledge base API.
