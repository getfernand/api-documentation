To interact with the Fernand API, you need to include your API key in every request.
This is done by passing it in the `X-Api-Key` header.

You can create and manage your keys directly from your Fernand dashboard under **Integrations → API Key**.

  **Security best practices:**
  
  * Keep your keys secret. Do not paste them into public repositories or client-side code.
  * Rotate your keys regularly for added security.
  * If you suspect a leak, revoke the key immediately from the dashboard.

## Making a request

Once you have an API key, include it in the header of your request. Here are some examples:
