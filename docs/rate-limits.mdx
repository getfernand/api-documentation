Rate limiting helps ensure fair usage of the Fernand API.
Understanding these limits will help you build robust integrations.

## Rate limits

By default, most endpoints are limited by the following restrictions:

 * 20 requests per minutes for accessing read-only endpoints (via the `GET` method)
 * 5 requests per minutes for accessing write endpoints (`PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`)

Some endpoints are different rate limits implemented based on their purpose.
When this is the case, we indicates how much actions you can perform per minutes on these endpoints.

<Warning>
  **Rate limit exceeded:** When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive an HTTP `429` status code. Monitor the rate limit headers (see below) to avoid hitting this limit.
</Warning>

## Rate limit headers

Each API response includes three headers to help you monitor your usage:

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Remaining" type="Integer">
  Indicates the number of requests remaining before hitting the rate limit.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Limit" type="Integer">
  Indicates the maximum number of requests you can make per minute.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Reset" type="Integer">
  Represents a Unix timestamp in seconds indicating when the rate limit will reset.
</ParamField>
