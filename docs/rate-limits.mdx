Rate limiting helps ensure fair usage of the Fernand API. Understanding these limits will help you build robust integrations.

## Rate limits by account type

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Unauthenticated">
    **2 requests per minute**
    
    Rate limiting is enforced for unauthenticated accounts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authenticated">
    **250 requests per minute**
    
    Authenticated accounts have significantly higher limits.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sandbox mode">
    **10 requests per minute**
    
    Reduced limits apply when using sandbox mode.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Rate limit exceeded:** When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive an HTTP `429` status code. Monitor the rate limit headers (see below) to avoid hitting this limit.
</Callout>

## Rate limit headers

Each API response includes three headers to help you monitor your usage:

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Remaining" type="Integer">
  Indicates the number of requests remaining before hitting the rate limit.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Limit" type="Integer">
  Indicates the maximum number of requests you can make per minute.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Reset" type="Integer">
  Represents a Unix timestamp in seconds indicating when the rate limit will reset.
</ParamField>

<Callout type="info">
  **Tip:** Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header to implement exponential backoff and avoid hitting rate limits in your application.
</Callout>
