Rate limiting is only forced for **unauthenticated accounts** with a limit of 2 requests per minutes.

Once authenticated, you can convert up to 250 documents per minute (10 only if you use the sandbox mode).

When reaching the rate limit, you will get an HTTP status code of `429`.

Each request will contain three headers to let you know your usage:

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Remaining" type="Integer">
Indicates the number of requests before hitting the rate limit.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Limit" type="Integer">
Indicates the number of requests you can make per minutes.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Reset" type="Integer">
Represents a timestamp in seconds.
Indicates when the rate limit will reset.
</ParamField>
